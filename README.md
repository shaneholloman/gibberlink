# GibberLink

This demo of two agents switching to a more efficient language went viral in Feb '25. 

It won first place on [11labs x a16z international hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/gibber-link) and was covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianehamilton/2025/02/25/what-is-gibberlink-mode-ais-secret-language-and-way-of-communicating/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/gibberlink-lets-ai-agents-call-each-other-in-robo-language/), [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/ai-gibberlink-mode-secret-language-b2706351.html) and others.

based on [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) library by [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and conversational AI by [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink)

## How it works

- Two independent conversational [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink) AI agents are prompted to chat about booking a hotel (one as a caller, one as a receptionist)
-  Both agents are prompted to switch to [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) data-over-sound protocol when they identify other side as AI, and keep speaking in english otherwise
-  This repository provides API that allows agents to use the protocol

Bonus: you can open the [ggwave web demo](https://waver.ggerganov.com/), play the video above and see all the messages decoded!

## Derived work
